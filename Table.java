     * "Kevin". The other player should be a computer player. These computer player
     * should have the name "Computer #1", "Computer #2", "Computer #3".
     * 
     * 3. Deal randomly 10 cards to each player. A card can only be dealt to one
     * player. That is, no two players can have the same card.

     * 4. Deal a card on each stack. The card dealt on the stack should not be dealt
     * to any player. Card dealt on each stack should also be unique (no two stack
     * have the same card).
